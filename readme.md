DevFinder is a web app that allows you to search for Github users and view their profiles using github's API.


## Features
- Search Github users by username
- Display user information such as name, bio, location, social media links, and statistics (repos, followers, following)
- Toggle between light and dark themes
- Fully responsive on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage

1. Enter a Github username in the search input field.
2. Click the "Search" button.
3. The user's profile information will be displayed, including their name, bio, location, social media links, and statistics.

## Theme Switching

You can switch between light and dark themes by clicking the theme toggle button in the top right corner of the application. The theme preference is saved in the local storage, so your selected theme will be remembered when you revisit the application.
